# How to define the close action for the ASPxPopupControl's Close button on the client side


<p>The ASPxPopupControl does not allow a developer to prevent a PopupControl from being hidden when the CloseButton is clicked based on a custom criteria.  A possible solution for this limitation is to use templates.  You should add a button to the PopupControl's HeaderTemplate container and decide whether a PopupControl should be closed or not when this button is clicked.</p>
